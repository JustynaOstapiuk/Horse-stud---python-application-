# Horse stud - python application
The aim of the work was to develop a complete desktop application product using the python programming language, which is a database application supporting the operations of the stable. Local XAMPP server was used. The designed system is designed to facilitate the work and increase the work productivity of the grooms, vets, blacksmiths together with the facility owners and stall tenants. The user should easily analyze each box and the data for each horse. The potential recipient of the designed system is a small or medium-sized farm (a recreational or sports stable) that wants to increase communication skills in managing the facility. The stable database is intended to store data on each horse in the stable. The database contains information about the horse (first name, mother's name, father's name, breed, date of birth, gender, owner ID and date of arrival of the horse in the stable). For each horse, we can check the feeding schedule (time, type of feed, supplementation, complementary food, who last fed the horse). In addition, each horse has information about the visit, for example, veterinarians, blacksmiths, stable employees.
